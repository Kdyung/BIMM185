DAVID:
Paste list of gene names. Select identifier (gene symbol or 'idk'). Ask what gene networks are these emphasized in. (Given 300 genes, see if they are in a similar network given an organism)
Select Species (done): converts to its own computational identifier and ask for what networks you want to discover. See disease and omen genes. (deselect omen) 
(click functional annotation clusters)
See how many clusters it found. They also give a false discovery rate. (Ex: under 10% [normal]) It helps to see if a drug is going to kill someone (want 0%). 
Functional Annotation Clustering (blue titled table with list of %s and p-values)
Now can take dataset and run through cytoscape.
